# About this project:
 This project demonstrates CRUD operations on Animals.
 On the client side, the project relies on Angular 17 version and syntax and Material UI. Signals were also used where I found it fit. e.g : animal-editor.ts (line 44) <br />
 On the server side, the project uses Nest.js for backend and reads/writes from/to animals.json file as database.<br />
 There is use of Ngrx store library for read/write operations and state management.<br />
 The project asks the user to set his name pre-starting the CRUD operations<br />
 Due to time limitation, the focus was less on pixel-perfecting and more on functionality.<br/>


# build/execute instructions:
git clone git@github.com:AngeiMachi/Angular-Nestjs-Server-Client-eample.git.<br />
If Nest.js not installed on machine :  npm i -g @nestjs/cli.<br />
cd client => npm install => npm run start.<br />
cd server => nmp install => npm run start.<br />
